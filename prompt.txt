Initial Prompt:
================

I want to prepare a chat application, where two users can interact with each other (send messages). 

- I want the messages to be displayed on real-time (no need to reload the page to get new messages) 
- Use Redis for that. 
- Keep the UI as simple as possible. 

Also explain the concepts involved in the activity... Especially how Redis is being used here.


==============
Hosting Part:
==============

I'm on MobaXterm SSH Client using EC2 instance running on AWS (Amazon Linux). 
Got it ? 
Now I want to host my redis-chat-app project on AWS... 
and get the IP address for it so that anyone can access the application. 
My code is available on github: https://github.com/Akshit-1201/redis-db-server 

Progress so far: 
- SSH Client is already running 
- Installed httpd on it 
- in the directory /var/www/html 
- Refer the Screenshot attached 
- State the detailed steps for hosting the application so that multiple users can use our application with the explanation.

===============
Database Part
===============

Now, I have a problem that whenever we refresh the website... 
the website's messages gets lost... Now add a database (preferably MySQL) 
so that the messages dont get lost upon refreshing.

And also add one more feature that the new user whenever he joins the chat... 
he gets previous 20 messages sent by the users who are already there chatting.
