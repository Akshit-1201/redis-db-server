I want to prepare a chat application, where two users can interact with each other (send messages). 

- I want the messages to be displayed on real-time (no need to reload the page to get new messages) 
- Use Redis for that. 
- Keep the UI as simple as possible. 

Also explain the concepts involved in the activity... Especially how Redis is being used here.
