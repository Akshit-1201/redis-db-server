I want to prepare a chat application, where two users can interact with each other (send messages). 

- I want the messages to be displayed on real-time (no need to reload the page to get new messages) 
- Use Redis for that. 
- Keep the UI as simple as possible. 

Also explain the concepts involved in the activity... Especially how Redis is being used here.

Hosting Part:
===========

I'm on MobaXterm SSH Client using EC2 instance running on AWS (Amazon Linux). Got it ? Now I want to host my redis-chat-app project on AWS... and get the IP address for it so that anyone can access the application. My code is available on github: https://github.com/Akshit-1201/redis-db-server Progress so far: - SSH Client is already running - Installed httpd on it - in the directory /var/www/html - Refer the Screenshot attached - State the detailed steps for hosting the application so that multiple users can use our application with the explanation.
